 * value (i.e. the one nearest to the head of the list).  For example, if a
 * list stores pointers to integers and contains two instances of the value 4,
 * only the first of those values should be removed, and the other one should
 * remain in the list.  Importantly, this function will also need to free the
 * memory held by the link being removed (it does not need to free the stored
 * value itself, just the link).
 *
 * This function will be passed a *function pointer* called `cmp` that you
 * should use to compare the value `val` to be removed with the values stored
 * in the list to determine which element (if any) to remove.  The cmp function
 * (which will be passed to list_remove() when it's called, so you don't have
 * to worry about writing it yourself) should be passed two void* values,
 * `val` and a value stored in the list against which to compare `val`.  If
 * the two values should be considered as equal, then the function will return
 * 0, and if the two values should be considered as not equal, then the
 * function will return a non-zero value.  For example, part of your code here
 * might look something like this (assuming you're comparing `val` to the `val`
 * field of a specific list link):
 *
 * if (cmp(val, link->val) == 0) {
 *   // Remove link from the list.
 * }
